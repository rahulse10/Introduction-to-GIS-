# 1. Introduction
In this section, we were introduced to the basic functionality and tools in ArcGIS Pro. 
We got familiar with the interface, learned how to add shapefiles to the map and how to identify and symbolize information in the shapefiles. We also learned how to make a layout of the map and export its image file.

## Maps Produced

![People vaccinated against COVID 19 with atleast one dose per inhabitant (As of August, 2021)](https://github.com/rahulse10/Introduction_to_GIS/blob/main/1.%20Introduction/Lab1_Map1.jpg)

## Datasets Used 

1. europe_covid19.shp (map) - Carlos Efráin Porto Tapiquén (EfrainMaps)
2. europe_capital_cities.shp - Carlos Efráin Porto Tapiquén (EfrainMaps)
3. Population and Coronavirus data - Worldometers.info (status for August 11, 2021)
4. Vaccination data - Our World in Data (status for August 11, 2021)

## Discussion
A basic map showing the vaccination status against COVID-19 for European nations was produced. 
Common tools like adding data, attribute tables, symbology, labels etc. were explored and used.
The map showed how there is a relatively higher percentage of people that were vaccinated in Western European nations compared to their Eastern counterparts.
