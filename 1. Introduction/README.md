##Discussion
A basic map showing the vaccination status against COVID-19 for European nations was produced. 
Common tools like adding data, attribute tables, symbology, labels etc were explored and used.
The map showed how there is a relatively higher percentage of people that were vaccinated in Western European nations compared to their Eastern counterparts.
