# 3. Projections and Georeferencing
In this section we explored map projections, and worked on changing projections of features and the use of inset maps.

## Maps Produced

![1. Comparision of Mercator and Equidistant projections on a World Map](https://github.com/rahulse10/Introduction_to_GIS/blob/main/3.%20Projections%20and%20Georeferencing/RS1_A4_Portrait1.jpg)

![2. Map of Norway with main centres in Oslo shown with an inset](https://github.com/rahulse10/Introduction_to_GIS/blob/main/3.%20Projections%20and%20Georeferencing/RS1_A4_Portrait.jpg)

## Dataset Used 

1. ne_100m_admin_0_countries.shp Natural Earth Data
2. norway_pop2017_n1000.shp SSB - Statistics Norway (data) and Kartverket (map)
3. tettsted2016.shp SSB - Statistics Norway2

## Discussion
This exercise explored different projections in map-making. The mesure distance tool was used to see the difference in result between Mercator and Equidistant projections (Area preserving). 
The difference between planar and geodesic measurements was also explored. The Eckert IV (Area preseving) projection was also compared.

With the second map, I learnt how to change projections of a dataset with the tool Define Projection. With the layout, I learnt how to add an inset using Extent Indicator.
The final map showed Norway with an inset map showing the built up areas in Oslo.
