# 3. Projections and Georeferencing
In this section we explored map projections and worked on changing projections of features and the use of inset maps.

##Maps Created

##Dataset Used 

1. ne_100m_admin_0_countries.shp Natural Earth Data
2. norway_pop2017_n1000.shp SSB - Statistics Norway (data) and Kartverket (map)
3. tettsted2016.shp SSB - Statistics Norway2

##Discussion
With the second map, I learnt how to change projections of a dataset with the tool Define Projection. With the layout, I learnt how to add an inset using Extent Indicator.
