# Introduction to Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
The repository stores data files for the 'Introduction to Geographical Information Systems' module. \
The assignments were offered at the University of Oslo. \
The README file presents an overview of all the maps created and the tools used. \
The folders have more details about the individual mapping projects. \
ArcGIS Pro was used for completing the exercises for this course. For Exercise 6, GeoDa was used to run the spatial autocorrelation test.

## Topics
| Topic | Description | Tools Used |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Introduction | ArcGIS Pro interface was introduced and a simple map of COVID-19 vaccination status in Europe was produced | Add data, Attribute Tables |
| Cartography and Data Visualization | Basic Cartographic priciples were introduced and two maps showing the population density of Norwegian municipalities and a world map showing population growth rate were produced | Symbology, Layout, Spatial Join |
| Projections and Georeferencing | Basics about map projections and how to change feature and map projections in ArcGIS Pro was introduced. A map comparing Mercator and Equidistant projects, and a map of Norway showing Oslo as an inset were produced| Measure distance, Define projections, Extent indicator
| Collecting Spatial Data | Spatial data was collected on a smartphone using the input app and imported to ArcGIS Pro. Features were prepared manually using Edit tools. | Edit - Create, Trace, Snapping |
| Spatial Analysis | Spatial Analysis tools were explored by creating a flood vulnerability map of Hamar, Norway | Buffer, Merge, Definition Query, Feature to Polygon, Clip, Feature to Point, Summarize within |
| Spatial Auto Corelation | GeoDa was used to perform Global and Local Moran's I test on percetage of votes to the labour party in 2017 election. A LISA Map was produced using QGIS to identify clusters of correlation for the data  | Weight file, Univariate Moran's I test, Univariate local Moran's I test.|
| Rasters | Four maps were produced for Bergen using its DTM and various Raster tools available. A map showing the green areas of Bergen using Sentinel 2 imagery was also produced. | 1. Raster Tools - Hillshade, Aspect, Slope, Contour. Imagery Tools - Green (NVDI)  |
